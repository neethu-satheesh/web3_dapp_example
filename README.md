## Philosophy of the application
This app is used as a playground for developers to learn and implement the various aspects of the blockchain and other techs used in the project. The idea is to inspire all to learn and work on blockchain.


## Getting started

  2) [Learn about blockchain](https://learn.kba.ai/course/blockchain-foundation-program/)
  3) [Learn about Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/)
  4) [Learn about Smart contract](https://trufflesuite.com/)
  5) [Learn about tools to create smart contract - Truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/truffle/)
  6) [Learn about tools to create a blockchain - Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/)
  7) [Learn about Nodejs](https://nodejs.dev/learn/introduction-to-nodejs)

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
